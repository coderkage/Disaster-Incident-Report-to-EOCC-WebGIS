# Disaster-Incident-Report-to-EOCC-WebGIS
This repository contains a Python application that facilitates the extraction, processing, and submission of disaster incident reports from KoboToolbox to the EOCC WebGIS platform. The application uses a GUI for user input, processes geospatial data, and exports the data as shapefiles to be uploaded to the EOCC dashboard.
